# The-multi-armed-bandit-problem

Introduction:

The multi-armed bandit problem is like trying to decide whether to stick with what you know or try something new. Imagine you're at a casino with a row of slot machines (the 'bandits'). You're faced with the dilemma of either playing the machine you know pays out occasionally (exploitation) or trying a new machine that might pay out more (exploration).

This report dives into how a specific strategy for tackling this problem, called a multi-armed bandit algorithm, performs under different conditions. We're particularly interested in how changing certain settings, known as 'epsilon values', affects how well the algorithm works.

Solutions:

The implemented solution consists of the following key components:

Action Value Selection Function (action_value): The agent makes decisions by estimating which slot machine is likely to give the best reward based on its past experiences. It follows a strategy called epsilon-greedy, which strikes a balance between trying out new options and sticking with the ones it knows. So, most of the time, it goes for the slot machine it thinks is the best (exploitation), but occasionally, it takes a risk and tries out a different one (exploration).

Bandit Algorithm (bandit_algo): The program runs through the multi-armed bandit scenario for a set number of rounds, with a certain number of slot machines (arms) available and a specific epsilon value chosen. As it progresses through each round, it keeps track of the rewards it gets from each machine and updates the estimated mean reward for each arm based on the rewards received.

Experimentation and Visualization: The experiment involves trying out various epsilon values - 0.1, 0.01, and 0 - and observing how they affect the algorithm's performance. To do this, we run the algorithm multiple times, each time with a different epsilon value. Then, we analyze the results by creating visualizations that show how the algorithm performs over time. This allows us to see which epsilon value works best for balancing exploration and exploitation in our scenario.

Results:

The experiments were conducted with the parameter given below:

1. Number of arms: 10
2. Number of time steps: 1000
3. Epsilon values: 0.1, 0.01, 0
4. Number of runs: 2000

Average Reward:

Higher epsilon values mean more exploration, which lowers initial average rewards, but as time steps increase, the average reward stabilizes, indicating a balance between exploration and exploitation.

Lower epsilon values prioritize exploiting known actions, resulting in higher initial average rewards, but they may lead to slower convergence to optimal actions due to less exploration of potentially better options.

Percentage of Optimal Action:

Higher epsilon values demonstrate increased exploration, leading to a higher percentage of optimal actions over time, albeit with lower initial percentages due to exploration taking precedence over exploitation initially.

Lower epsilon values mean less exploration, resulting in a quicker convergence to optimal actions and higher initial percentages of optimal actions, indicating a focus on exploiting known options rather than exploring new ones.

Discussion of Results:

Exploration vs. Exploitation:

The findings illustrate the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Higher epsilon values promote exploration, enhancing the discovery of optimal actions, whereas lower epsilon values prioritize exploitation, potentially facilitating quicker convergence to optimal actions.

Impact of Epsilon Values:

The selection of epsilon greatly impacts the algorithm's effectiveness. Opting for higher epsilon values proves advantageous in situations where exploration is vital for achieving long-term benefits, whereas lower epsilon values are preferable in scenarios prioritizing the exploitation of known options.

Reliability and Stability:

The algorithm exhibits resilience and consistency across multiple runs, as indicated by the convergence of average rewards and percentages of optimal action over time.
